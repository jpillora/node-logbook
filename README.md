Logbook
============

Yet another logger for Node. Nothing fancy - logs all data that passes through `process.stdout` and `process.stderr` (includes `console.log` and `console.error`). If you don't wish to log something, delete the code. Your program should only be logging things you wish to see.

### Goals

* **Simple**
* Use process.stdout and process.stderr the two log channels
* Log to:
  * Console
  * File
  * Loggly
  * ???

### Usage

```
npm install logbook
```

``` javascript
require('logbook').configure({
  console: {
    enabled: false
  },
  loggly: {
    client: {
    }
  }
});
```

*See examples directory*

### Default Configuration

By default `logbook` has no effect, it will simply pass
all output back the associated pipe (stdout or stderr).

``` javascript
{
  console: {
    enabled: true,
    timestamps: false,
    typestamps: false
  },
  loggly: {
    enabled: false,
    inputToken: null,
    subdomain: null
  },
  file: {
    enabled: false,
    timestamps: false,
    typestamps: false,
    log: "./log.txt",
    err: "./err.txt"
  }
}
```

### Loggly

Each log will be in the form

``` javascript
{
  type: "log" OR "err"
  msg: LOGSTRING
}
```
This will be JSON encoded, so ***please only use HTTPS+JSON inputs!***

#### `inputToken`

The token provided by loggly which identifies the input (or data bucket)
that you're logging to.

#### `subdomain`

The loggly subdomain used to identify your account.

### Custom Log Handlers

``` javascript
require('logbook').configure({
  ...
}).add(function(type, buffer) {
  type === 'log' || type === 'err';   //true
  buffer instanceof Buffer;           //true
});
```
