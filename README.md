Logbook
============

Yet another logger for Node.

Nothing fancy - logs all data that passes through `process.stdout` and `process.stderr` (`console.log()` and `console.error()`).

### Features

* **Simple**
* Intercepts `process.stdout` and `process.stderr` producing two log levels:
  * `LOG`
  * `ERR`
* Optionally log to:
  * Console
  * File
  * Loggly
  * XMPP (Google Talk)
  * [Make your own](https://github.com/jpillora/node-logbook#custom-log-handlers)

### Usage

```
npm install logbook
```

### Log to File

Disable console and log `stdout` `stderr` to `log.txt` and `err.txt` with a time stamp:

``` javascript
require('logbook').configure({
  console: {
    enabled: false
  },
  file: {
    enabled: true
  }
});
```

### Log to Loggly

Disable console and send `stdout` `stderr` to [Loggly](https://app.loggly.com/pricing/) (200MB/day free):

``` javascript
require('logbook').configure({
  console: {
    enabled: false
  },
  loggly: {
    enabled: false,
    inputToken: "abcd1234-1234-40bd-bddf-5ff562eb1cda",
    subdomain: "my-subdomain"
  }
});
```

### Log to XMPP a.k.a "Jabber" (Google Talk)

Disable console and send `stdout` `stderr` to everyone in your contact list:

``` javascript
require('logbook').configure({
  console: {
    enabled: false
  },
  xmpp: {
    enabled: true,
    jid: '...@gmail.com',
    password: '...'
  }
});
```

### Log to all the thingsss

``` javascript
require('logbook').configure({
  console: {
    enabled: true
  },
  file: {
    enabled: true,
    ...
  },
  loggly: {
    enabled: true,
    ...
  },
  xmpp: {
    enabled: true,
    ...
  }
});
```

*See [examples](https://github.com/jpillora/node-logbook/tree/master/examples) directory for more*

### Default Configuration

By default `logbook` has no effect, it will simply pass
all output back the associated pipe (stdout or stderr).

``` javascript
{
  console: {
    enabled: true,
    timestamps: false,
    typestamps: false
  },
  loggly: {
    enabled: false,
    inputToken: null,
    subdomain: null
  },
  file: {
    enabled: false,
    timestamps: true,
    typestamps: false,
    log: "./log.txt",
    err: "./err.txt"
  },
  xmpp: {
    enabled: false,
    jid: null,
    password: null,
    host: 'talk.google.com',
    port: 5222,
    to: "*",
    delay: 100,
    log: false,
    err: true
  }
}
```

### Custom Log Handlers

Add custom log handlers with `add()`

``` javascript
require('logbook').configure({
  ...
}).add(function(type, buffer) {
  type === 'log' || type === 'err';   //true
  buffer instanceof Buffer;           //true
});
```

### **API**

Configure loggers with `configure()`

#### File

* Writes will also append to each file

#### Loggly

Each log will be in the form

``` javascript
{
  type: "log|err"
  msg: "..."
}
```

This will be JSON encoded, so ***please only use HTTPS+JSON inputs!***

##### `inputToken`

The token provided by loggly which identifies the input (or data bucket)
that you're logging to.

##### `subdomain`

The loggly subdomain used to identify your account.

#### XMPP

##### `to`

An array of `jid` Jabber IDs (Google Accounts in the case of Google Talk).
By default it's the string "*", which means everyone in the given
accounts contact list. Useful if you create
a logbook Jabber account, then you can "subscribe" to it at will.

##### `delay`

This is the delay (in milliseconds) before all acculated messages are sent out.
This helps trying to send thousands of messages concurrently resulting from a
long synchronous loop.  

### Conceptual Overview

This module simply assigns a new functions to `process.stdout|err.write`. Captures
all calls to it, calls the original versions when `console.enabled true`.

### Todo

* Make a CLI looking for a `logbook.json` file
  * Wraps `logbook <script.js>` logs all `stdout` `stderr`
  * Auto restarts, logging restart events
* Add some tests
